# Welcome to ♯SHAARP._ml_ 

**♯SHAARP**._ml_ is an open-source package for modeling reflected and transmitted optical second harmonic generation (SHG) of slab and multilayer structures of nonlinear optical materials. 

This package builds upon a general approach to solve the Maxwell equations under proper boundary conditions to obtain the SHG responses of various materials systems. The package is designed to handle **arbitrary number of layers, number of SHG active media, crystal symmetry, crystal orientations, complex refractive indices, and polarized incident lights**. The two most common SHG characterization approaches, Maker fringes and polarimetry, are integrated into the package. 

**♯SHAARP**._ml_ is also a successor of the [**♯SHAARP**._si_](https://github.com/Rui-Zu/SHAARP), which was designed for modeling the reflected SHG responses of a single-interface system. 

You can find detailed [documentation of **♯SHAARP**._ml_ here](https://shaarpml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). 

# Features and Applications 

**♯SHAARP**._ml_ exhibits unique features for modeling the SHG responses with **flexibility, high-fidelity, high accuracy, high efficiency, user-friendliness, and extensibility**.   

Key features of **♯SHAARP**._ml_ include:  
- **Flexibility** 🌈: User have freedom in defining the multilayer structure, materials properties, incident lights, and assumptions for the SHG polarization. 
- **High-fidelity** ✔: The calculation results of **♯SHAARP**._ml_ have been verified by benchmarking with established analytical theories in literature and experimental validation of more than eight material systems  
- **High accuracy**🎯: The solutions are all semi-analytical with minimal numerical approximations.   
- **High efficiency** 🚀: It typically takes just a few seconds to calculate the result for a single incidence and a few minutes for a parametric study such as Maker fringes simulation.  
- **User-friendliness** 👍: With well-designed GUI and documentations, more than ten preset cases studies and tutorials videos
- **Extensibility**💻: Beside the GUI, it is programmable with modularized functions.   

**♯SHAARP**._ml_ is designed for two types of studies:  
1. To numerically simulate SHG responses of nonlinear optical materials and  heterostructures  
2. To obtain analytical expressions of SHG responses and fit experimental measurements to determine the nonlinear optical properties of materials 

# Quickstart 

## Installation 

- ♯SHAARP._ml_ is written as a notebook using Wolfram Language and the access to _Mathematica®_ or *Wolfram Player* is required to run **♯SHAARP**._ml_ on PC/Mac. Please refer to the [Installing Mathematica](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/tutorial/InstallingMathematica.html).
- Download SHAARP.ml_V\#\.zip in the latest release from [here](https://github.com/bzw133/SHAARP.ml).
- Unzip the file and you will obtain two _Mathematica®_ notebooks: 
	- SHAARP.ml.nb
	- setup.nb

## Run the SHAARP.*ml* notebook 
- Open SHAARP.ml.nb 
- Make sure that Dynamic Evaluation is enabled, evaluate the notebook by clicking `Evaluation > Evaluate Notebook` from the menu bar. Note that this process clears all the definitions from the other currently open notebooks. 
- You will get the welcome page as:
